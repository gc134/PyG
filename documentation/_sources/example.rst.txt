The example file (germination_table_ex.csv) was used all along
developments to manually test the application. It can also be useful to
become familiar with the interface thanks to a simple and explicit dataset.

This example file contains artificial data, chosen in order to get a clear
distinction between groups. These are germinated seeds counts for 9 samples
(seed batches) on a 54 hours span. The 9 samples are shared out 3 groups
(genotypes, conditions, treatments...) of contrasted germination capacity, group 1 having the
highest vigor, group 2 the lowest, and nÂ°3 being intermediate. These artificial
data provide a case where the germination parameters don't respond the same
way.

This example file can serve as a gold standard for data set-up. A specific
data structure is required for this application to work that is illustrated
by this file.
