PyG is a PyQt5 interface developped in Python3 for Windows 10. It is designed to
process germination data, in the form of raw counts of germinated seeds over time. It intends to
represent germination curves, to fit them in order to
extrapolate usual germination parameters. The variations of these parameters
between groups (genotypes, conditions, treatments...) are then represented.
The last part of PyG is dedicated to a simple statistical analysis to further
select the most interesting parameters and better characterize the variations of germination aspects
